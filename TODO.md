## What the hibbity-badibbity?
- empty application properties file 
- proper config file sample
- siteDef <-- ? --> siteInst

  - example sample
  - test sample
  - why so many samples??
- look at the reports templates
- look at the metrics templates
- do we have an api document
  - there was a plugin for making docs from springboot. is that used?
